           Women think twice before stepping out of their
          house, they live in constant fear. Some of them are even subjected to
          domestic violence and not well aware of constitutional laws and the
          organisations to whom they can ask to help them. So our aim is to
          provide safety as well creating awareness about constitutional rights
          and various NGOs to help them. <br/>
